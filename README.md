### 1️⃣ Check if Git is Installed

Before starting, make sure Git is installed on your computer.

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repo

<pre>git clone "https://github.com/MiN6JI/intern.git"
cd intern
git checkout branch-name
git add .
git commit -m "Changes"
git push origin main
</pre>

### ⚠️ Branch Usage Policy

- Do **not** work directly on the `main` branch.
- Each developer must work on their **own branch** (e.g., `rutuja`, `rahul`, `neha`, etc.).
- Commit and push changes only to your assigned branch.
- Create a **Pull Request** to merge your branch into `main` after review.

🔒 The `main` branch is protected — direct commits or pushes are not allowed.
